## Calling External JavaScript File ##

This plugin makes an external call to a JavaScript file to function properly. This is necessary to retrieve user-specific chatbot parameters.

The external call to the JavaScript file is done as follows:

- File Name: [IdForChatbot].js
- File URL: https://leadbooster.com.br/chatbot/[IdForChatbot].js

This practice is adopted to allow users to embed the chatbot on their website.

We understand the importance of keeping file calls local. However, in this case, it is essential for the proper functioning of the leadbooster application, and we provide this explanation for greater transparency.

If you have any questions or concerns about the external JavaScript file call, please contact us at suporte@leadbooster.com.br for more information.
